//! The screen trait, and the state machine that owns the stack.
//!
//! # Transitions are values
//!
//! `docs/plan.md`: *"A screen is a trait, and screens do not know about each
//! other. Each screen handles input, updates, and draws into the canvas;
//! transitions are returned as values to the state machine
//! performed by the screen. A screen that can push another screen is a screen
//! that will eventually own the whole game."*
//!
//! So a screen returns a [`Transition`], and it names its destination with a
//! [`ScreenId`] — a plain value. It cannot construct another screen, cannot
//! hold one, and cannot reach the stack: the only type that can is [`Machine`],
//! so [`ScreenId::build`] is the single place any screen is made.
//!
//! # Draw cannot mutate
//!
//! [`Ctx`] carries `&mut Game`, and `draw` is handed `&Ctx`
//! `&mut Ctx`. The compiler enforces it.
//! that drawing a frame cannot change the world. A renderer that can nudge the
//! simulation is a renderer that makes the simulation depend on how often it
//! drew, and `docs/netcode.md` does not allow that.
//!
//! A screen may still mutate **itself** while drawing (`&mut self`), which is
//! how the campaign map caches its painted tiles and its pick plane.
