# Working with parallel agents

This project is far larger than one context window. Agents are how it scales, and file
ownership is how they stay out of each other's way.

## Ownership

| Resource | Owner |
|----------|-------|
| `docs/status.html` | lead session only |
| `crates/l2-formats/` | lead session only — agents report logic to integrate, they don't edit it |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, `docs/symbols.md` | lead session only |
| A format doc under `docs/formats/` | whichever agent is working that format |
| A tool subdirectory under `tools/` | whichever agent created it |

Give every agent its own output files. Two agents editing one document will clobber each
other, and neither will notice.

## Ghidra

**Only one process may hold a Ghidra project at a time.** Concurrent agents must use
separate project directories under `E:\dev\ghidra-projects` — e.g. `lords2` for the game
binary and `mapl2` for the shipped map editor. Say so explicitly in the agent's brief;
this is not obvious and the failure mode is a lock error mid-run.

Copy `ghidra_scripts/DecompileFunc.java` into a per-agent script directory rather than
having several agents edit the shared one.

## Briefing an agent

Include, every time:

- The paths and how to run things (or point at `docs/environment.md`)
- **What is already established**, so they don't re-derive it
- **What was already tried and failed**, and why
- The validation standard — what would make their conclusion trustworthy
- Which files they own and which they must not touch
- That they must not commit, must not copy GPL code, and must not modify the game install

Ask for reports that separate **verified** from **inferred**, and that state what remains
unknown. An agent reporting "done" without saying what it could not establish is a report
you cannot act on.

## What agents are good and bad at here

**Good:** bounded investigations with a clear validation test (crack a format, find a
function, validate a hypothesis across a corpus). High-volume mechanical work where a
verifier exists — decoder loops, bindings, batch extraction with round-trip checks.

**Bad:** open-ended interpretation of decompiler output with no way to check the answer.
That is where a confident, wrong result costs more than it saves. A cheap model is safe
exactly where a verifier exists, and dangerous everywhere else.

## Commit *your own* paths, and know that `git add` is not enough

`git add -A` sweeps up whatever every other agent has written so far, which means
committing half-finished work under an unrelated message — and, once, fifteen rendered PNGs
of game data straight past the first rule of the project.

So stage explicit paths. **But staging explicitly does not make the commit safe**, and this
cost us a second time: `git commit` commits **the whole index**, not the paths you happened
to add. If another agent has already staged something — a file rename, say — your commit
takes it too, however careful your `git add` was. One agent swept another's staged renames
this way while following the explicit-path rule to the letter.

The form that actually holds names the paths on the **commit**:

```bash
git commit -F msg.txt -- crates/l2-mods docs/modding.md   # yes: only these, whatever the index holds
git add crates/ && git commit -F msg.txt                  # no: commits the whole index
git add -A                                                 # never
```

`git commit -- <paths>` bypasses the index for those paths and commits exactly what you
name. Check `git status --short` first and confirm every path is yours; when several agents
are live, that check is necessary and not sufficient, and the `--` form is what closes the
gap.

**One catch, and it bites on the first commit of anything new.** `git commit -- <paths>`
only accepts paths git already knows, so a brand-new file fails with
`pathspec … did not match any file(s) known to git`. A new file must be `git add`-ed first,
and *then* committed with the `--` form:

```bash
git add tools/oracle/xref.js
git commit -F msg.txt -- tools/oracle/xref.js    # add makes it known, -- keeps it alone
```

The `git add` is safe here because it names one path; it is the bare `git commit` afterwards
that would sweep the index, and the `--` prevents exactly that.

**And a second catch, sharper than the first: `--` is wrong for removals.**
`git commit -- <paths>` commits the **working tree** at those paths and ignores the index.
That is exactly what makes it safe for edits — and it silently *reverses* a deletion you
staged with `git rm --cached`, because the file is still on disk. Untracking 1,891 build
artefacts this way put all 1,891 straight back, and the commit looked like it had worked.

So the honest rule is not "always use `--`". It is:

| what you are doing | form |
|---|---|
| adding or editing files, agents live | `git commit -F msg -- <paths>` |
| a **removal** (`git rm --cached`) | stage it, check `git status`, plain `git commit` |
| a brand-new file | `git add <path>` first, then the `--` form |

A removal cannot be isolated by `--`, so it has to be done when the index is otherwise
empty — which means **when no other agent is mid-edit.** If you need to untrack something
while agents are running, wait.

## Clean up processes you start

**Any agent that launches a process must terminate it before reporting.** The game in
particular takes over the entire screen, so leaving it running blocks the user from
seeing their own desktop, and they have no way to tell whether the agent is still using
it or simply abandoned it.

```powershell
Stop-Process -Name Lords2,l2-view,dxwnd -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

Run that at the end of the task whether it succeeded or not. Put the requirement in the
brief — an agent told it may run the game will not infer that it should also close it.

Prefer short focused sessions with the game over keeping it open across a long
investigation, and if a task genuinely needs it open for a long stretch, say so in the
report so the cost is visible.

## Prior art first

Before commissioning a reverse-engineering task, spend five minutes searching for existing
documentation or tools. This project lost real effort re-deriving a format that was already
published. Make it the first step in the brief.
